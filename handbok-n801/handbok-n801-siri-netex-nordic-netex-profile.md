# HÃ¥ndbok N801 \(SIRI/NeTEX\) : Nordic NeTEx Profile

The profile \(formerly the Norwegian NeTEx profile\) features a focused set of features from the full NeTEx design which sets the scope of usage for the Nordic countries. The profile was developed starting in 2015 with real-world needs of the Nordic public transport situation in mind and aims to be fully compliant with the European NeTEx profile.
