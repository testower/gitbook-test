## Train passing by stops <a id="SIRI-ET-Cancelledinthemiddleoftheroutebeforedeparture-Trainpassingbystops"></a>

With cancellations in the middle of a route, it is inferred that the vehicle will pass by certain stops and proceed directly, or by a different route, to the final stop. In this example, a train passes by the station at Dovre without stopping, but otherwise operates normally.

For cancellations of the "rest of the route", see: [SIRI-ET - Kjøretøy delinnstilt før avgang](handbok-n801-siri-netex-siri-et-cancelled-before-departure.md).
